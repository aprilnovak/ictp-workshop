# Google Collab Notebooks

A notebook which contains the full solutions can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HJS9ZYryws7-SkZMwS8SNuTX26BO0DgJ).

An empty notebook which can be used to follow along can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JOVPNixP8_N71rNzjxQwMj6rscTuDip_?ts=68d01d68).

In order to work along in these notebooks, you need to save a copy to your Google Drive account (File -> Save a Copy in Drive). This allows each attendee to make modifications to a local copy without changing the file for everyone.
